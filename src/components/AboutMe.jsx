        I am a self-taught web developer who has a natural talent and passion for computers. At the moment I leave a double life, working as a Data Analyst during the day and coding my own projects at night. My goal is to launch a full-time web developer career and now I feel more ready than ever. For the last 5 years I have been following a steep learning curve improving my PHP, JavaScript, and CSS skills. At the back-end from a complete spaghetti PHP code to a more OOP structure following the MVC design patterns with the support of frameworks like Laravel. At the front-end from a total chaos of files, to a modular approach using NodeJS and Webpack, and from a clunky redundant coding style to building reusable components using VueJS and React always keeping up with the DRY rule. I am also becoming less dependent to libraries like JQuery and sticking to Vanilla JS whenever it is possible. In addition, due to the nature of my current job I am proficient with relational databases.
